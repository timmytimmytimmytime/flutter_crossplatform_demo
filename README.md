# flutter_crossplatform_demo

A **Flutter demo app** showing clean compilation across **Web**, **Android**, **iOS**, and **macOS** targets.

This project demonstrates Flutterâ€™s ability to maintain a consistent build pipeline and UI experience across platforms using a single codebase.

## ðŸ§© Overview
- Built entirely in **Dart + Flutter**.
- Designed for a **mobile viewport** (390Ã—844) even on web/desktop â€” intentionally constrained for demo purposes.
- Currently uses **static layout and data**.
